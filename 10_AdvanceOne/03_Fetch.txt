Fetch is just a method used now a days to do request on the server it was just implementd in node js,
before that it was just used in browser, so earlier we used XMLhttp methodes for request but after introduction
to fetch method to node we started using it because it is easy to use and have good syntax for that

so, fetch has two things one goes to the memory allocation which allocate the memory and one is who goes to webbrowser/node
so the step include the data allocated in memory which has two arrays one is onResolve and on is onRejection then next step
is we do network request through webbrowser or node and depending on the situation either we get the request or we fail 
and if it was a success then the data goes to onResolve array and through that it goes to fullfill the data allocated or if there is an error 
pulling req it goes to the onRejection and through there it goes to the data to fullfill after the data is fullfiled then the data goes to the response 
which is globally accesseble

data, onRejection, onResolve are not accesebile they are private fields

when we get a error response 404 - file not found it goes to onResolve only.
