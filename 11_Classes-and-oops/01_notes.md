# Javascript and Classes

## Does javascript has classes ?
- Javascript is prototype based language, and yes it has classes which is just introduced in ES6 but it is just a syntactic sugar provided for the developers who are coming from class based programming

## Objects
- Collection of methoes and properties

## OOPS

## part of oops
Object literals

- Constructors
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instances(new, this)

## 4 pillars

- Abstraction : So abstraction is just like a tv remote , we don't know what is happenig inside but we are using it, so its just hiding the details and showing only the essential parts to make somthing easier to understand

- Encapsulation : It is like keeping your belongings inside the suitcase, like bundling your data and methods working on that data iniside one unit, so the unit protects them from outside interference, encapsulation make your code less complex and make more easy to organize

- Inheritence : It means just passing your traits to your children, like one new class take the functionality and method from the existing class to use so it helps in reusable code.

- Polymorphism : Polymorphism in programming is like a person who can do multiple jobs depending on the situation. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This means that a single interface can be used to represent different underlying forms or types. For example, you could have a Shape superclass with a method called area(), and different subclasses like Circle and Rectangle that implement this method differently based on their specific shapes.
